# 04: Forces

force: a push or pull on an object

## Types of Forces 

**Gravitational force (F<sub>g</sub> or W)**: towards planet center   
W = mg  
F = GmM/r<sup>2</sup>   
G: universal Gravitational constant

**Normal force (F<sub>N</sub> or N)**: perpendicular to surface   

**Tension (F<sub>T</sub> or T)**: with string, rope, cable, rod, etc.  

**Applied force (F<sub>a</sub>)**: in touch with object

**Spring force (F<sub>s</sub>)**: force on spring when compressed or stretched  
Hooke's Law: F<sub>S</sub> = -kx   
opposite to applied force on spring

**Friction force (F<sub>f</sub>)**: force opposite to direction of motion  
static: for objects at rest; F<sub>f<sub>S</sub></sub> &le; &mu;<sub>S</sub>F<sub>N</sub>  
kinetic: for objects in motion; F<sub>f<sub>K</sub></sub> = &mu;<sub>K</sub>F<sub>N</sub>  
&mu;<sub>S</sub> &ge; &mu;<sub>K</sub>

**Drag force (F<sub>D</sub>)**: force opposite to direction of motion in fluid or gas  
F<sub>D</sub> = bv or bv<sup>2</sup>

**Electric force (F<sub>e</sub>)**: attractive/repulsive interaction between charged objects

**Magnetic force (F<sub>B</sub>)**: force exerted by moving charges

## Newton's Laws of Motion

**1st Law (Law of Inertia)**: object at rest stays at rest, object in motion stays in motion, unless there is an external force

**2nd Law (F = ma)**: force is the product of an object's mass and acceleration

**3rd Law (Action-Reaction)**: every action has an equal and opposite reaction

## Applications of Newton's 2nd Law
