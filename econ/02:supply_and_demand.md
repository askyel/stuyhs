# 02: Supply and Demand

## Demand  

quantity demanded: actual amount of a good or service consumers would buy at a specific price 
 
demand curve: visualizes relationship between quantity demanded and price  

**Law of Demand**: the higher the price of a good or service, the lower its quantity demanded

movements along demand curve: change in quantity demanded resulting from change in price  

change in demand: shift of demand curve, changes quantity demanded at any given price
- increase in demand = rightward shift of demand curve
- decrease in demand = leftward shift of demand curve

### Factors That Shift the Demand Curve 
1. changes in prices of related goods or services  
	* increase in price of substitute -> increases demand
	* increase in price of complement -> decreases demand
2. changes in income
	* normal good: rise in income -> increases demand
	* inferior good: rise in income -> decreases demand
3. changes in tastes
4. changes in expectations
	* expect future price increase -> increases demand
5. changes in the number of consumers
	* market demand curve: horizontal sum of all individual demand curves 

## Supply

quantity supplied: actual amount of a good or service producers would sell at specific price

supply curve: visualizes relationship between quantity supplied and price

**Law of Supply**: the higher the price of a good or service, the higher its quantity supplied

movements along supply curve: change in quantity supplied resulting from change in price

change in supply: shift of supply curve, changes quantity supplied at any given price
* increase in supply = rightward shift of supply curve
* increase in demand = leftward shift of supply curve

### Factors That Shift the Supply Curve
1. changes in input prices
	* increase in input prices -> decreases supply
2. changes in prices of related goods or services
	* increase in price of substitute -> decreases supply
	* increase in price of complement -> increases supply
3. changes in technology
4. changes in expectations
	* expect future price increase -> decreases supply 
5. changes in the number of producers
	* market supply curve: horizontal sum of all individual supply curves

## Supply and Demand Model

![model] (images/supply_and_demand_model.gif)

competitive market: no individual's actions can influence price of good or service

### Equilibrium

equilibrium price: price that matches quantity supplied and demanded

equilibrium quantity: quantity of goods bought/sold at equilibrium price

equilibrium point = intersection of supply and demand curves

surplus: occurs when quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded

shortage: occurs when quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied

### Changes in Equilibrium
