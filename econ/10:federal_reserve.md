### Federal Reserve Policies

#### The Reserve Requirement

federal funds market: allows banks that fall short of reserve requirement to borrow funds from banks with excess reserves

federal funds rate: interest rate determined in the federal funds market
+ high federal funds rate lowers amount of money loaned out, increases average interest rate for individual customers

lowering the required reserve ratio increases the money supply, increasing the required reserve ratio decreases the money supply

#### The Discount Rate

discount rate: interest rate the Fed charges on loans to banks

usually above the federal funds rate to discourage banks from borrowing Fed money

if Fed reduces the difference between the discount rate and federal funds rate -> banks increase lending -> money supply increases  
if Fed increases the difference between the discount rate and federal funds rate -> banks decrease lending -> money supply decreases

#### Open-Market Operations

open-market operation: purchase or sale of government debt by the Fed

Federal Reserve assets - government debt (treasury bills)  
Federal Reserve liabilities - monetary base (currency in circulation and bank reserves)

increase monetary base by purchasing treasury bills from commercial banks -> increases money supply  
decrease monetary base by selling treasury bills to commercial banks -> decreases money supply
