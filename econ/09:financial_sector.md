# 09: The Financial Sector

## Saving, Investment, and the Financial System

interest rate: price (percentage of amount borrowed) charged by lenders to borrowers for use of their savings for one year

### Savings-Investment Spending Identity

savings-investment spending identity: savings and investment spending are equal

*In a simplified economy...*  
total income = total spending  
total income = consumer spending + savings  
total spending = consumer spending + investment spending  
consumer spending + savings = consumer spending + investment spending  
savings = spending  

*Economy is also affected by government saving.*    
budget surplus: difference between tax revenue and government spending (+)  
budget deficit: difference between tax revenue and government spending (-)  
budget balance: refers to both budget surplus and budget deficit  
national savings: sum of private savings and budget balance  
 
*Economy can receive inflows of funds from foreign savings or generate outflows.*  
capital inflow: net inflow of funds into a country  
- a dollar from national savings is repaid with interest domestically, whereas a dollar from capital inflow is repaid with interest to a foreigner  
- investment spending from capital savings comes at a higher national cost

*In a globally affected economy, identity holds with savings equal to sum of national savings and capital flow.*

### The Financial System

wealth: value of a household's accumulated savings, invested in financial markets

financial asset: paper claim that entitles the buyer to future income from the seller
- types of financial assets: loans, stocks, bonds, bank deposits

physical asset: claim on a tangible object that gives owner the right to dispose of it as he/she wishes

liability: requirement to pay money in future

#### Tasks of a Financial System

**Reducing Transaction Costs**  
transaction costs: expenses of negotiating/executing a deal  
bond market allows companies to borrow large sums of money without large transaction costs

**Reducing Risk**  
financial risk: uncertainty about future outcomes that involve financial losses or gains  
ideal financial system reduces people's exposure to risk  
diversification: investing in several assets so possible losses are independent events

**Providing Liquidity**  
liquid asset: can quickly be converted into cash without much loss of value  
illiquid asset: cannot be quickly converted into cash without much loss of value  

#### Types of Financial Assets

**loans**: lending agreement between individual lender and borrower  

**bonds**: IOU issued by borrower, seller usually pays fixed interest each year  
default: borrower fails to make payments as specified by contract  
liquid because they are easy to resell

**loan-backed securities**: asset created by pooling individual loans and selling shares in pool

**stocks**: shares in the ownership of a company  
asset from owner's point of view and liability from company's point of view    
produces higher return to investor than bond, but carries higher risk

#### Financial Intermediaries

financial intermediary: institution that transforms funds gathered from many individuals into financial assets  

**mutual funds**: creates stock portfolio, resells shares of portfolio to individual investors

**pension funds**: type of mutual fund that holds assets to provide retirement income to its members

**life insurance companies**: sell policies that guarantee a payment to a policyholder's beneficiaries when policyholder dies

**banks**: provides liquid assets (bank deposits) to lenders, uses funds to finance illiquid investment spending needs of borrowers  
bank deposit: claim on bank, obligies blank to return cash to depositor on demand

## Definition and Measurement of Money

### Meaning of Money

money: any asset that can easily be used to purchase goods and services

currency in circulation: cash held by public

checkable bank deposits: bank accounts on which people can write checks 

money supply: total value of financial assets in economy considered money 

generates gains from trade by making indirect exchange possible

### Roles of Money

**medium of exchange**: asset individuals acquire for purpose of trading goods/services rather than for consumption  

**store of value**: means of holding purchasing power over time  

**unit of account**: measure used to set prices and make economic calculations  

### Types of Money

**commodity money**: good used as medium of exchange that has intrinsic value otherwise

**commodity-backed money**: medium of exchange with no intrinsic value, ultimately value guaranteed by convertability into valuable goods

**fiat money**: medium of exchange whose value derives entirely from official status as means of payment  

### Measuring the Money Supply

monetary aggregates: overall measure of the money supply

## The Time Value of Money

present value: $1 -> $1/(1 + r)^N, r is interest rate, N is number of years

net present value: present value of current and future benefits minus present value of current and future costs

## Banking and Money Creation

### The Monetary Role of Banks

banks create liquidity by providing depositors with liquid assets and investing depositors' funds in illiquid assets

bank reserves: currency banks hold in their vaults plus deposits at the Federal Reserve

T-account: tool for analyzing business's financial position, business's assets (left) and liabilities (right)

reserve ratio: fraction of bank deposits that bank holds as reserves

required reserve ratio: smallest fraction of deposits Federal Reserve allows banks to hold (10% in the USA)

### Bank Runs

usually only a small fraction of depositors wish to withdraw funds simultaneously  
if a larger share of depositors demanded money, bank would fail to meet those demands  
most of depositor's funds are converted into loans (illiquid)  

bank run: many of bank's depositors try to withdraw their funds due to fear of a bank failure 

### Bank Regulation

**deposit insurance**: guarantee that depositors will be paid, even if bank can't produce funds, up to max per account

**capital requirement**: owners of banks must hold substantially more assets than value of bank deposits, net worth (7%)

**reserve requirement**: rules determining required reserve ratio for banks (10%)

**discount window**: Federal Reserve is on demand to lend money to banks (avoid selling of bank assets), discount rate is interest rate

### Determining the Money Supply

*How Banks Create Money*  
- initial deposit (no change in money supply)
- percentage of deposit loaned out (increase in money supply by amount of loan)
- spent loan deposited by seller (no change in money supply)
- percentage of new deposit loaned out (proportional increase in money supply) ...

excess reserves: bank's reserves beyond its required reserves

monetary base: sum of currency in circulation and bank reserves

money multiplier: ratio of money supply to monetary base

banking multiplier (money multiplier) = 1 / reserve ratio  
change in excess reserves * money multiplier = change in money supply

## The Money Market

### The Demand for Money

#### Opportunity Cost of Holding Money

Liquid currency provides convenience, but earns no interest

short-term interest rates: rates on financial assets that mature within a year

long-term interest rates: rates on financial assets that mature a number of years later, generally higher than short-term rates

#### Money Demand Curve

money demand curve: relationship between quantity of money demanded and interest rate

![money_demand] (images/money_demand.gif)

higher interest rate increases opportunity cost of holding money 

*nominal interest rate on the y-axis*

use interest-bearing assets to buy money

#### Shifts of Money Demand Curve

**Changes in Aggregate Price Level**  
higher prices increase demand for money  
lower prices decrease demand for money  

**Changes in Real GDP**  
increased GDP increases demand for money  
decreased GDP decreases demand for money

**Changes in Technology**  
advances in technology decreases demand for money  

**Changes in Institutions**  
bank interest on checking accounts increases demand for money

### Money and Interest Rates

#### Equilibrium Interest Rate

liquidity preference model of interest rate: interest rate determined by supply and demand for money 

money supply curve: how quantity of money supplied varies with interest rate

## The Market for Loanable Funds

### Modeling the Market for Loanable Funds

market for loanable funds brings together savers and borrowers

loanable funds market: hypothetical market that illustrates market outcome of demand for funds generated by borrowers and supply of funds provided by lenders

vertical axis measures the nominal interest rate for a given expected future inflation rate

rate of return = (revenue - cost) / cost * 100%

businesses aim for a loan with an interest rate greater than or equal to the rate of return 

![loanable_funds] (images/loanable_funds.png)

#### Shifts of the Demand for Loanable Funds

**Changes in perceived business opportunities**  
belief in greater rate of return increases demand for loanable funds  

**Changes in government's borrowing**  
governments with budget deficits increase demand for loanable funds  
crowding out: government deficit drives up the interest rate, leads to reduced investment spending

#### Shifts of the Supply of Loanable Funds

**Changes in private savings behavior**  
less saving (more spending) decreases the supply of loanable funds 

**Changes in capital inflows**  
greater capital inflows increase supply of loanable funds 

#### Inflation and Inflation Rates

shifts of supply and/or demand curves for loanable funds change the interest rate

real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

Fisher effect: increase in expected future inflation increases nominal interest rate; expected real interest rate is unchanged

### Two Interest Rate Models

#### Interest Rate in the Short Run

fall in interest rate leads to rise in investment spending, which increases real GDP and consumer spending, rise in GDP increases savings to match investment spending

![interest_short] (images/interest_short.png)

increase in money supply leads to fall in interest rate  
decrease in money supply leads to rise in interest rate

#### Interest Rate in the Long Run

changes in money supply don't affect interest rate

aggregate price level rises by same proportion as increase in money supply, real GDP returns to original level as nominal prices rise
