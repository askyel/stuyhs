# 05: Inflation

real wage = wage rate / price level  
real income = income / price level  
*level of prices doesn't impact real wage and real income*

inflation rate = (price level year 2 - price level year 1) / price level year 1

*high rates of inflation impose significant economic costs*  
shoe-leather costs: increased costs of transactions due to inflation  
menu costs: real costs of changing listed prices  
unit-of-account costs: arise because inflation makes money less reliable unit of measurement

nominal interest rate: interest rate actually paid for a loan

real interest rate: nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation  
real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

*if inflation rate is higher than expected* -> borrowers gain  
*if inflation rate is lower than expected* -> lenders gain

disinflation: process of reducing inflation rate

### Calculation of Inflation

aggregate price level = measure of overall prices in economy

market basket = hypothetical set of consumer purchases of goods and services

price index = cost of market basket in given year / cost of market basket in base year

consumer price index: measures cost of market basket of typical urban American family

producer price index: measures changes in prices of goods and services purchased by producers

GPA deflator = 100 * nominal GDP / real GDP
