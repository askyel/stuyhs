### AIM: How can we model the causes fo inflation?

#### Classical Model of Money and Prices

for given level of potential output (i.e. "long-run" output)  
% change M = % change PL

this is shown as moving from one point on LRAS curve to another  

reconciled w/ more Keynesian model as moving along vertical portion of SRAS curve

Classical model ignores short-run changes

indp central banks issue fiat money

inflation tax: increased prices paid by private sector when gov spending increases (esp. when gov prints money, inflation is high

#### Causes of Inflation

cost-push inflation in economy: GDP goes down, unemployment goes up  

demand-pull inflation: GDP goes up, unemployment goes down

Output Gap and the Unemployment Rate  


if actual output = potential output, actual unemployment = natural rate of unemployment  
ao > po, au 

### AIM: How is inflation modeled in the short and long run Phillips Curves? 

low unem, high infl  
high unem, low infl

inverse relationship btw inflation and unemployment  

moving AD curve moves along SRPC

wage share = wages / national income

national income = wages (labor) + rent (land) + profit (entrepeneurship) + interest (capital)  
payments from firms to households through resource market  
firms profit from spending in product market (total spending -> GDP )   

Why should the Fed raise interest rates?  

expansionary policy -> lower interest rates  
liquidity trap: reached 0 lower bound on interest rates, no expansionary monetary policy possible

lower income households more likely to borrow, with debt deflation aggregate demand reduced, less spending  

Great Depression - Soviet Union

Keynes General Theory of Unemployment, Interest, and Money

Friedman: keep money supply constant, business cycle unchanging

Quantity Theory of Money

MV = PY

# Inflation and Unemployment

## History and Alternate Views of Macroeconomics

### Classical Macroeconomics

#### Money and the Price Level

prices are flexible, making AS curve vertical even in short-run  
increase in money supply leads to proportional rise in aggregate PL  
- no effect on aggregate output  
- inflation  

stresses long term effects over short-run

#### The Business Cycle

effective measurement of business cycle, but no consensus on business cycle theory

### Great Depression and Keynesian Revolution

Great Depression inspired closer inspection of short-run economics 

#### Keynes's Theory

focused on effects of shifts in AD on aggregate output

argued that other factors, e.g. "business confidence", influence business cycles

#### Policy Against Recessions

macroeconomic policy activism: use of monetary/fiscal policy to smooth out business cycle

### Challenges to Keynesian Economics

#### Revival of Monetary Policy

Keynes's downplayed the effectiveness of monetary policy

Friedman and Schwartz argued that Fed should act to prevent monetary contraction

fiscal policy (changing tax rates, gov spending), involves political choice  
monetary policy (changing central bank interest rates) eliminates need for choice

#### Monetarism

monetarism: assets that GDP will grow steadily if money supply does  

discretionary monetary policy: use of changes in interest rate or money supply to stabilize economy

monetary policy rule: formula that determines bank's actions

Quantity Theory of Money: emphasizes positive relationship btw PL and money supply  
velocity of money: ratio of nominal GDP to money supply, M x V = P x Y  

#### Inflation and the Natural Rate of Unemployment
