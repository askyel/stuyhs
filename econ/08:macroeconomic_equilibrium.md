# 08: Macroeconomic Equilibrium

## Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply Model

short-run macroeconomic equilibrium: quantity of aggregate output = quantity demanded  

shortages and surpluses create pressures toward equilibrium, through changing production levels and prices

Negative Supply Shock: leads to stagflation (inflation, but no economic growth)

Positive Supply Shock: leads to higher output, less upward pressure on prices
