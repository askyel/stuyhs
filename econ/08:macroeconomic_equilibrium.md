# 08: Macroeconomic Equilibrium

## Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply Model

short-run macroeconomic equilibrium: quantity of aggregate output = quantity demanded  
+ point at which AD and SRAS curves intersect

### Shifts of AD: Short-Run Effects

cause aggregate PL and output to move in same direction

negative demand shock: shifts AD curve leftwards, reducing aggregate PL and output  
positive demand shock: shifts AD curve rightwards, increasing aggregate PL and output

### Shifts of SRAS

cause aggregate PL and output to move in opposite directions

negative supply shock: shifts SRAS curve left, increasing aggregate PL and reducing aggregate output
+ raises production costs and reducers quantity suppliers are willing to sell
+ leads to stagflation (inflation, but no/negative economic growth)

positive supply shock: shifts SRAS curve right, reducing aggregate PL and increasing aggregate output
+ reduces production costs and increases quantity suppliers are willing to sell

### Long-Run Macroeconomic Equilibrium

long-run macroeconomic equilibrium: when point of short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is on LRAS

![lr_equil] (images/lr_equil.png)

recessionary gap: when aggregate output is below potential output  
+ correponds with high unemployment

inflationary gap: when aggregate output is above potential output
+ corresponds with low unemployment 

output gap: percentage difference between actual aggregate and potential output  

economy is self-correcting when AD shocks affect aggregate output in short run, but not long run
 
## Economic Policy and AD-AS Model

stabilization policy: use of government policy to reduce affect of recessions and expansions

policy makers respond to negative demand shock using monetary and fiscal policy to return aggregate demand to normal level

expansionary fiscal policy: increases aggregate demand (eliminate recessionary gap)
+ increase in goverment purchases of goods/services
+ cut in taxes
+ increase in government transfers

contractionary fiscal policy: reduces aggregate demand (eliminate inflationary gap)
+ reduction in government purchases of goods/services
+ increase in taxes
+ reduction in government transfers

## Fiscal Policy and the Multiplier

Fiscal policy affects aggregate demand.

multiplier: ratio of change in real GDP caused by autonomous change in aggregate spending to size of autonomous change

change in government transfers or taxes shifts AD curve by less than equal-sized change in government purchases, causing smaller effect on real GDP

lump-sum taxes: taxes independent of taxpayer's income
+ rarely imposed by government

taxes dependent positively on real GDP reduce multiplier size

automatic stabilizers: government spending/taxation rules causing fiscal policy to be automatically expansionary when economy contracts, contractionary when economy expands 
+ unemployment benefits

discretionary fiscal policy: fiscal policy resulting from deliberate actions by policy makers rather than rules
