## Gross Domestic Product

GDP: total value of all final goods and services produced in economy during given year  

### Ways to Calculate GDP

1. sum total value of firms' production of final goods and services
2. add up aggregate spending on domestically produced final goods and services
3. sum the total factor income earned by household firms in the economy

value added = value of sales - value of purchases and inputs

GDP = C + I + G + X - IM
* C = consumer spending
* I = investment spending
* G = government purchases of goods and services
* X = exports
* IM = imports
* X - IM = net exports
