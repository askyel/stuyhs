### AIM: How can we model the causes fo inflation?

#### Classical Model of Money and Prices

for given level of potential output (i.e. "long-run" output)  
% change M = % change PL

this is shown as moving from one point on LRAS curve to another  

reconciled w/ more Keynesian model as moving along vertical portion of SRAS curve

Classical model ignores short-run changes

indp central banks issue fiat money

inflation tax: increased prices paid by private sector when gov spending increases (esp. when gov prints money, inflation is high

#### Causes of Inflation

cost-push inflation in economy: GDP goes down, unemployment goes up  

demand-pull inflation: GDP goes up, unemployment goes down

Output Gap and the Unemployment Rate  


if actual output = potential output, actual unemployment = natural rate of unemployment  
ao > po, au 

### AIM: How is inflation modeled in the short and long run Phillips Curves? 

low unem, high infl  
high unem, low infl

inverse relationship btw inflation and unemployment  

moving AD curve moves along SRPC

wage share = wages / national income

national income = wages (labor) + rent (land) + profit (entrepeneurship) + interest (capital)  
payments from firms to households through resource market  
firms profit from spending in product market (total spending -> GDP )   

Why should the Fed raise interest rates?  

expansionary policy -> lower interest rates  
liquidity trap: reached 0 lower bound on interest rates, no expansionary monetary policy possible

lower income households more likely to borrow, with debt deflation aggregate demand reduced, less spending  

Great Depression - Soviet Union

Keynes General Theory of Unemployment, Interest, and Money

Friedman: keep money supply constant, business cycle unchanging

Quantity Theory of Money

MV = PY

### AIM: How do balance of payments accounts chart international economic activity?

payments for assets  
payments for goods/services, factor income, and transfers  

interest rates increase: inflows increase, outflows decrease  
better to keep savings in that country 

US contractionary monetary policy  
-> discount rate increase, Fed selling gov securities (open market operation, most frequently used), rr increase   
-> money supply decreases  
-> interest rate increases  
-> investment spending decreases, net capital inflows increases  
-> financial account balance toward surplus   

currency of quantity in x-axis, price measured in units of currency on y-axis  

### The Equilibrium Exchange Rate 

FOREX: 

appreciation: price of currency increased  
depreciation: price of currency decreased  

demand increase -> new demand for nation's product, higher interest rate 

floating exchange rate: no ov intervention (generally assumed on AP), determined by market alone  

fixed exchange rate: gov intervenes to keep at/near target by intervening in foreign exchang market  
- buy/sell assets  
- central bank changes interest rate  
- limits on indvidual rights to buy foreign currency  

### Net export effect 

monetary policy is reinforced through net exports

expansionary  
- three tools  
- money supply  
- interest rate  
- demand for domestic assets 
- effect on foreign exchange market  
- effect on net exports  
- effect on AD  
- effect on real GDP  
- effect on PL  

US Expansionary Policy
1. MS increases  
2. IR decreases  
3. Demand for domestic assets decreases  
4. Demand for dollars decreases
5. Dollar depreciates 
6. Net exports increase
7. AD increases  
8. real GDP
