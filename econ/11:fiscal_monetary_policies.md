# Fiscal and Monetary Policies

## Long-Run Implications of Fiscal Policy: Deficits and the Public Debt

### The Budget Balance

government savings = tax revenues - government spending - government transfers  
Sg = T - G - TR

expansionary fiscal policies reduce budget balance  
contractionary fiscal policies increase budget balance  

budget tends to move into deficit during recession  
budget tends to move into surplus during expansion

cyclically adjusted budget balance: estimate of the budget balance if real GDP were to equal to potential output

### Long-Run Implications of Fiscal Policy

fiscal year: Oct 1 to Sept 30, used to label budget totals

public debt: government debt held by individuals and institutions outside the government

*problems posed by rising government debt:*  
government borrowing can "crowd out" private investment spending  
deficits place financial pressure on future budgets

debt-GDP ratio: government's debt as % of GDP

impact liabilities: spending promises made by governments (effectively debt)

## Monetary Policy and the Interest Rate

### Monetary Policy and the Interest Rate

target federal funds rate: desired level for federal funds rate, Fed adjusts money supply through open-market operations  
open-market purchase of bonds -> increase in money supply  
open-market sale of bonds -> decrease in money supply

### Monetary Policy and Aggregate Demand


expansionary monetary policy: monetary policy that increases aggregate demand  
Fed expands money supply -> lower interest rate -> more spending -> higher real GDP

contractionary monetary policy: monetary policy that reduces aggregate demand  
Fed contracts money supply -> higher interest rate -> less spending -> lower real GDP

### Monetary Policy in Practice

policy makers aim to stabilize prices, maintain low inflation

expansionary policy, lower interest rate, when real GDP is below potential output (smaller output gap)

contractionary policy, higher interest rate, when real GDP is above potential output (larger output gap)

Taylor rule for monetary policy: federal funds rate = 1 + (1.5 * inflation rate) + (0.5 * output gap)

inflation targeting: central bank sets explicit target for inflation rate, sets monetary policy to hit that target
