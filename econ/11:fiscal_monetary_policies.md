## Long-Run Implications of Fiscal Policy: Deficits and the Public Debt

### The Budget Balance

government savings = tax revenues - government spending - government transfers  
Sg = T - G - TR

expansionary fiscal policies reduce budget balance  
contractionary fiscal policies increase budget balance  

budget tends to move into deficit during recession  
budget tends to move into surplus during expansion

cyclically adjusted budget balance: estimate of the budget balance if real GDP were to equal to potential output

### Long-Run Implications of Fiscal Policy

fiscal year: Oct 1 to Sept 30, used to label budget totals

public debt: government debt held by individuals and institutions outside the government

*problems posed by rising government debt:*  
government borrowing can "crowd out" private investment spending  
deficits place financial pressure on future budgets

debt-GDP ratio: government's debt as % of GDP

impact liabilities: spending promises made by governments (effectively debt)
