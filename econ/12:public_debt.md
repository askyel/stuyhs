### AIM: Who cares about public debt?

T > G + Transfers, then surplus  
T < G + Transfers, then deficit  
==> flow variables (for one year)  
==> debt is a stock variable  

#### Budget Balance as a Measure of Fiscal Policy

Sgov = T - (G + Transfers)

Expansionary policies reduce budget balance

Contractionary policies increase budget balance

A dollar of G has greater impact on AD than a dollar of T or Transfers

Are changes in the budget balance the result or cause of economic fluctuations

Surplus is not necessarily beneficial - stimulus, unnecessary production volume?

Discretionary Policy: 

Nondiscretionary Policy: automatic stabilizers, cyclically based
