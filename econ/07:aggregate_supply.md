# 07: Aggregate Supply

aggregate supply curve: shows relationshp between aggregate price level and quantity of aggregate output supplied in economy

## Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve

in short run, positive relationship between aggregate price level and quantity of aggregate output supplied

profit = revenue - costs  
profit per unit = price per unit - production per unit

wages are largest source of inflexible production cost  
+ nominal wage: dollar amount of wage paid  
+ sticky wage: nominal wages that are slow to change in changing labor climate  
	+ slow to fall with high unemployment  
	+ slow to rise with labor shortages

short-run aggregate supply curve: shows positive relationship, time period when production costs are fixed  

movement down SRAS curve -> deflation, lower aggregate output

### Shifts of the Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve 

#### Changes in Commodity Prices
commodity: standardized input bought/sold in bulk quantities  
increase in commodity price -> SRAS curve shifts left  
decrease in commodity price -> SRAS curve shifts right

#### Changes in Nominal Wages
increase in nominal wages -> SRAS curve shifts left  
decrease in nominal wages -> SRAS curve shifts right  

#### Changes in Productivity
increase in productivity -> SRAS curve shits right  
decrease in productivity -> SRAS curve shifts left

## Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve 

in long run, no affect of aggregate price level on quantity of aggregate output supplied 

long-run aggregate supply curve: shows constant relationship, time period when production costs are flexible 

potential output: level of real GDP economy would produce if all prices, including nominal wages, were fully flexible  
actual potential output fluctuates around potential output 

long-run growth
+ increases in resource quantity (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship)
+ increases in resource quality, better-educated workforce
+ technological progress
-> same factors shift PPC outward

## From Short-Run to Long-Run

economy exists in one of two states  
+ on both SRAS and LRAS curves, at point where curves cross
+ on only SRAS curve

SRAS curve shifts over time until economy is at point where curves cross  
actual aggregate output = potential output
