Present Value and Future Value Defined

fv = (1 + r)^t * pv

pv = fv / (1 + r)^t

assume once-annually compounded interest

AIM: How do banks create money?

Difference btw monetary supply and monetary base

More than half of the M1 (money supply) is currency in circulation

The rest is demand deposits - what are these?

MONETARY BASE
bank reserves, currency in circulation

MONEY SUPPLY
currency in circulation, checkable bank deposits

T Account

shows assets and liabilities

net worth = difference btw assets and liabilities

loans are assets for banks, but liabilities for other firms

bank reserves: cash in bank vault

reserve ratio: amount of reserves / deposits

required reserve ratio: legal minimum percentage of deposits that banks are required to keep on reserve

excess reserves: bank reserves in addition to required reserve ratio

How Banks Create Money

deposits - nothing happens to money supply

when money is loaned out - bank creates money

if loan is payed back, money is destroyed

banking multiplier (money multiplier) = 1 / reserve ratio

change in excess reserves * money multiplier = change in money supply

old * mm  = new
