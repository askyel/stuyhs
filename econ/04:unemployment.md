# 04: Unemployment

## Unemployment Rate

employed: currently holding job (full-time or part-time)

unemployed: *actively looking* for work, but not currently employed

labor force = employed + unemployed

unemployment rate = unemployed / labor force

**can overstate true level of unemployment**  
unemployment rate is never 0, even in buoyant labor market

**can understate true level of unemployment**  
discouraged workers: nonworking people who have given up on seeking a job  
marginally attached workers: recently stopped looking for a job  
underemployed: work part time but cannot find full time job  

during recession -> unemployment rate rises  
during economic expansion -> unemployment *does not* always fall

## Categories of Unemployment

**frictional unemployment**: due to time workers spend in job search
* inevitable due to process of job creation/destruction, new workers entering labor market
* relatively harmless

**structural unemployment**: more people seeking jobs in labor market than jobs available
* results from high minimum wage
* results from labor union collective bargaining
* results from efficiency wages (wages set above equilibrium rate as incentive for better performance)

natural rate of unemployment: normal unemployment level arising from frictional and structural unemployment
 
**cyclical unemployment**: deviation of actual rate of unemployment from natural rate  
actual unemployment = natural unemployment + cyclical unemployment

## Structural Unemployment Models

**Model 1: "labor market rigidities"**
- some prevent wages from falling to equilibrium
	- minimum wages
	- labor unions 
	- side effects of public policy
- other rigidities prevent matching workers to jobs
	- skills mis-match
	- geographic immobility

**Model 2: efficiency wages paid to keep cost of job loss up, keep effort up (labor extraction)**
- Janet Yellen (current Fed chair)
- employers can "elicit more work by paying above-market wages"
- but when many firms pay efficiency wages, threat of *unemployment* is motivator
- allow firm to pay less for management (oversight of employees)

**Model 3: Labor-saving technological as endogenous, dynamic**
- firms speed up labor-saving technological change when wages rise
	- increases "reserve army of the unemployed"
	- puts downward pressure on wages
	- labor becomes relatively cheaper, reducing incentive for labor-saving technological change
- historically, people have feared technological change eliminating people's jobs, destroying current economic system
