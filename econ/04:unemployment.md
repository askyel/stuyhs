# 04: Unemployment

## Unemployment Rate

employed: currently holding job (full-time or part-time)

unemployed: *actively looking* for work, but not currently employed

labor force = employed + unemployed

unemployment rate = unemployed / labor force

**can overstate true level of unemployment**  
unemployment rate is never 0, even in buoyant labor market

**can understate true level of unemployment**  
discouraged workers: nonworking people who have given up on seeking a job  
marginally attached workers: recently stopped looking for a job  
underemployed: work part time but cannot find full time job  

during recession -> unemployment rate rises  
during economic expansion -> unemployment *does not* always fall

## Categories of Unemployment

**frictional unemployment**: due to time workers spend in job search
* inevitable due to process of job creation/destruction, new workers entering labor market
* relatively harmless

**structural unemployment**: more people seeking jobs in labor market than jobs available
* results from high minimum wage
* results from labor union collective bargaining
* results from efficiency wages (wages set above equilibrium rate as incentive for better performance)

natural rate of unemployment: normal unemployment level arising from frictional and structural unemployment
 
**cyclical unemployment**: deviation of actual rate of unemployment from natural rate  
actual unemployment = natural unemployment + cyclical unemployment
