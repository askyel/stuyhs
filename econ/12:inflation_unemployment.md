# 12: Inflation and Unemployment

## Types of Inflation, Disinflation, and Deflation

### Money and Inflation

#### Classical Model of Money and Prices 

in short-run, increase in money supply increases real GDP  
lowers interest rate and stimulates spending  

in long-run, real GDP returns to original level  
nominal wages and "sticky prices" rise  
leads to equal percentage rise in overall PL

real quantity of money = nominal MS / aggregate PL (M/P)  

classical model of the PL: real quantity of money is always at long-run equilibrium level  
1. economy is intially at equilibrium (intersection of SRAS, LRAS)  
2. expansionary policy increases MS, shifts AD right  
3. nominal wages adjust to corresponding PL, shifting SRAS back left  
4. long-run increase in PL is proportional to increase in MS  
classical model ignores short-run movement of equilibrium

#### Inflation Tax

US gov raises revenue by printing money  
1. Treasury issues debt to finance gov spending  
2. Fed monetizes debt by creating money, buying debt back from public (open-market operations)  

increases in money supply lead to increases in aggregate PL

inflation tax: reduction in value of money held by the public caused by inflation  

#### Logic of Hyperinflation

seignorage = &Delta;M  
real seignorage = &Delta;M/P  
real seignorage = rate of growth of MS * real MS  

with high inflation, public reduces real money quantity  
with less consumer spending, gov increases money supply  
inflation rate increases further -> hyperinflation

### Moderate Inflation and Disinflation

cost-push inflation: inflation caused by increase in price of input  

demand-pull inflation: inflation caused by increase in aggregate demand

#### Output Gap and Unemployment Rate

potential output: level of real GDP economy would produce with fully adjusted prices 

output gap: % difference between actual level of real GDP and potential output

actual output = potential output, actual unemployment = natural rate  
actual output < potential output, actual unemployment < natural rate  
actual output > potential output, actual unemployment > natural rate  

## Inflation and Unemployment: The Phillips Curve

### Short-Run Phillips Curve 

short-run Phillips curve: negative short-run relationship between unemployment rate and inflation rate 

![phillips_curve] (images/phillips_curve.png)

negative supply shock shifts SRPC upwards  
positive supply shock shifts SRPC down  

increase in expected inflation shifts SRPC upwards  
decrease in expected inflation shifts SRPC downwards 

### Inflation and Unemployment in the Long Run

in the long-run, inflation incorporated into expectations  
no trade-off between inflation and unemployment

![lr_phillips_curve] (images/lr_phillips_curve.gif)

nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU): unemployment rate at which inflation does not change over time

LRPC intersects unemployment rate axis at NAIRU

NAIRU = natural rate of unemployment  

disinflation: process of reducing inflation, requires unemployment rate above NAIRU

### Deflation

deflation: falling aggregate PL

debt deflation: reduction of AD from increase in real burden of outstanding debt

zero bound: nominal interest rate cannot fall below 0  
liquidity trap: IR at 0 bound, monetary policy ineffective  

## History and Alternate Views of Macroeconomics

### Classical Macroeconomics

#### Money and the Price Level

prices are flexible, making AS curve vertical even in short-run  
increase in money supply leads to proportional rise in aggregate PL  
- no effect on aggregate output  
- inflation  

stresses long term effects over short-run

#### The Business Cycle

effective measurement of business cycle, but no consensus on business cycle theory

### Great Depression and Keynesian Revolution

Great Depression inspired closer inspection of short-run economics 

#### Keynes's Theory

focused on effects of shifts in AD on aggregate output

argued that other factors, e.g. "business confidence", influence business cycles

#### Policy Against Recessions

macroeconomic policy activism: use of monetary/fiscal policy to smooth out business cycle

### Challenges to Keynesian Economics

#### Revival of Monetary Policy

Keynes's downplayed the effectiveness of monetary policy

Friedman and Schwartz argued that Fed should act to prevent monetary contraction

fiscal policy (changing tax rates, gov spending), involves political choice  
monetary policy (changing central bank interest rates) eliminates need for choice

#### Monetarism

monetarism: assets that GDP will grow steadily if money supply does  

discretionary monetary policy: use of changes in interest rate or money supply to stabilize economy

monetary policy rule: formula that determines bank's actions

Quantity Theory of Money: emphasizes positive relationship btw PL and money supply  

velocity of money: ratio of nominal GDP to money supply, M x V = P x Y  

#### Inflation and the Natural Rate of Unemployment

natural rate hypothesis: to avoid accelerating inflation, unemployment rate must be high enough that actual inflation = expected inflation

#### Political Business Cycle

political business cycle: results when politicians use macroeconomic policy to serve political ends

### Rational Expectations, Real Business Cycles, New Classical Macroeconomics

new classical macroeconomics: shifts the AD curve only affect aggregate PL, not output

rational expectations: view that individuals/firms make decisions optimally

new Keynesian economics: market imperfections can lead to price stickiness for whole economy

real business cycle theory: fluctuations in rate of growth of total factor productivity cause business cycle
