# 06: Aggregate Demand

## Determinants of Spending

disposable income: income from all revenue streams after taxes are paid  
dissaving: borrowing or reduction in saving

DI = C + S
+ DI: disposable income  
+ C: consumption expenditure
+ S: saving

household income divided into 5 quintiles

## The Multiplier

any change in spending multiplied due to MPC  
increased investment spending -> increased income and aggregate output -> increased disposable income -> increased consumer spending -> increased firm output -> ... 

marginal propensity to consume (MPC): increase in consumer spending when disposable income rises by $1    
MPC = &Delta; Consumer spending / &Delta; Disposable income 

marginal propensity to save (MPS): increase in household savings when disposable income rises by $1  
MPS = &Delta; Consumer saving / &Delta; Disposable income 

1 = MPC + MPS (MPC and MPS are between 0 and 1)   
![mpc_mps] (images/mpc_mps.gif)

increase in investment spending = $100 billion  
second-round increase in consumer spending = MPC * $100 billion  
third-round increase in consumer spending = MPC<sup>2</sup> * $100 billion ...  
-> total increase in GDP = (1 + MPC + MPC<sup>2</sup> + ...) * $100 billion = 1/(1 - MPC) * $100 billion  

autonomous change in aggregate spending: initial rise or fall in aggregate spending, causes series of income/spending changes

multiplier: ratio of total change in real GDP caused by autonomous change in aggregate spending to size of autonomous change  
&Delta; Real GDP = 1/(1 - MPC) * &Delta; Autonomous change in aggregate spending  
&Delta;Y = 1/(1 - MPC) * &Delta;A = 1/MPS * &Delta;A   
multiplier = &Delta;Y/&Delta;A = 1/(1 - MPC)  
minimize change -> MPC = 0  
maximize change -> MPC = 1  
MPC and multiplier have *direct* relationship 

## Consumer Spending

consumption function: equation showing how individual household's consumer spending varies with the household's current disposable income

autonomous consumer spending: amount of money household would spend if it had no disposable income  

aggregate consumption function: relationship for economy as a whole between aggregate current disposable income and aggregate consumer spending   
aggregate consumption function: C = A + MPC * DI

### Shifts of Aggregate Consumption Function

aggregate consumption function shifts when something other than disposable income changes

*changes in expected future disposable income*: expected increase causes upward shift of consumption function  
permanent income hypothesis: consumer spending depends on income people expect to have rather than their current income 

*changes in aggregate wealth*: wealth increase causes upward shift of consumption function  
life-cycle hypothesis: consumers plan spending over their lifetime, not just in response to current disposable income

## Aggregate Expenditures

"initial change in spending"  
price level is exogenous value  
determined by all variables, other than disposable income level, which affect total spending level  

AE = C + I + G + (X - M)  

### Keynesian Cross 
![keynesian] (images/keynesian.gif)  
equilibrium represented by 45deg line  
total expenditures = total income  
slope of aggregate expenditure line is MPC  

![keynesian_gap] (images/keynesian_gap.gif)  
recessionary gap: amount by which output is too low

## Investment Spending

planned investment spending: investment spending that businesses intend to undertake during given period

higher interest rates -> lower investment spending

higher expected GDP -> higher investment spending

higher current production capacity -> lower investment spending

inventories: stocks of goods held to satisfy future sales

inventory investment: value of change in total inventories  
unplanned inventory investment: 
+ actual sales < expected, positive inventory investment 
+ actual sales > expected, negative inventory investment  

actual investment spending = planned investment spending + unplanned inventory investment

factors that cause investment spending to decrease:
+ increased interest rate  
+ decreased capitol goods
 
## Aggregate Demand Curve 

aggregate demand curve: relationship between *aggregate price level* and *quantity of aggregate output*

![agg_demand_curve] (images/agg_demand_curve.png)

### Causes of Demand Curve Downward Slope

**wealth effect**: change in aggregate price level due to change in consumer spending from difference in purchasing power of consumers' assets

**interest rate effect**: change in aggregate price level due to change in investment and consumer spending from altered interest rates affecting demand for money

### Shifts of Aggregate Demand Function

change in aggregate price level causes movement along aggregate demand curve

#### Changes in Expectations
consumers and firms become more optimistic -> aggregate demand increases  
consumers and firms become more pessimistic -> aggregate demand decreases

#### Changes in Wealth
real value of household assests rises -> aggregate demand increases  
real value of household assets falls -> aggregate demand decreases 

#### Size of Existing Physical Capital
existing stock is small -> aggregate demand increases  
existing stock is large -> aggregate demand decreases

#### Fiscal Policy
government increases spending or cuts taxes -> aggregate demand increases  
government reduces spending or raises taxes -> aggregate demand decreases

#### Monetary Policy
central bank increases money quantity -> aggregate demand increases  
central bank decreases money quantity -> aggregate demand decreases
