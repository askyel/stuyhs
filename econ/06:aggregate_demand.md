# 06: Aggregate Demand

## Determinants of Spending

disposable income: income from all revenue streams after taxes are paid  
dissaving: borrowing or reduction in saving

DI = C + S
+ DI: disposable income  
+ C: consumption expenditure
+ S: saving

household income divided into 5 quintiles

## The Multiplier

increased investment spending -> increased income and aggregate output -> increased disposable income -> increased consumer spending -> increased firm output -> ... 

marginal propensity to consume (MPC): increase in consumer spending when disposable income rises by $1    
MPC = &Delta; Consumer spending / &Delta; Disposable income 

marginal propensity to save (MPS): increase in household savings when disposable income rises by $1  
MPS = &Delta; Consumer saving / &Delta; Disposable income 

1 = MPC + MPS (MPC and MPS are between 0 and 1)

increase in investment spending = $100 billion  
second-round increase in consumer spending = MPC * $100 billion  
third-round increase in consumer spending = MPC<sup>2</sup> * $100 billion ...  
-> total increase in GDP = (1 + MPC + MPC<sup>2</sup> + ...) * $100 billion = 1/(1 - MPC) * $100 billion 

autonomous change in aggregate spending: initial rise or fall in aggregate spending, causes series of income/spending changes

multiplier: ratio of total change in real GDP caused by autonomous change in aggregate spending to size of autonomous change  
&Delta; Real GDP = 1/(1 - MPC) * &Delta; Autonomous change in aggregate spending  
multiplier = 1/(1 - MPC)

## Consumer Spending

consumption function: equation showing how individual household's consumer spending varies with the household's current disposable income

autonomous consumer spending: amount of money household would spend if it had no disposable income  

aggregate consumption function: relationship for economy as a whole between aggregate current disposable income and aggregate consumer spending   
aggregate consumption function: C = A + MPC * DI

### Shifts of Aggregate Consumption Function

aggregate consumption function shifts when something other than disposable income changes

*changes in expected future disposable income*: expected increase causes upward shift of consumption function  
permanent income hypothesis: consumer spending depends on income people expect to have rather than their current income 

*changes in aggregate wealth*: wealth increase causes upward shift of consumption function  
life-cycle hypothesis: consumers plan spending over their lifetime, not just in response to current disposable income

## Investment Spending

planned investment spending: investment spending that businesses intend to undertake during given period

higher interest rates -> lower investment spending

higher expected GDP -> higher investment spending

higher current production capacity -> lower investment spending

inventories: stocks of goods held to satisfy future sales

inventory investment: value of change in total inventories  
unplanned inventory investment: 
+ actual sales < expected, positive inventory investment 
+ actual sales > expected, negative inventory investment  

actual investment spending = planned investment spending + unplanned inventory investment
