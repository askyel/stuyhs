# 06: Aggregate Demand

<sub><sup>increased investment spending -> increased income and aggregate output -> increased disposable income -> increased consumer spending -> increased firm output -> ... </sup></sub> 

marginal propensity to consume (MPC): increase in consumer spending when disposable income rises by $1    
MPC = &Delta; Consumer spending / &Delta; Disposable income 

marginal propensity to save (MPS): increase in household savings when disposable income rises by $1  
MPS = 1 - MPC

increase in investment spending = $100 billion  
second-round increase in consumer spending = MPC * $100 billion  
third-round increase in consumer spending = MPC<sup>2</sup> * $100 billion ...  
- - - 
total increase in GDP = (1 + MPC + MPC<sup>2</sup> + ...) * $100 billion
