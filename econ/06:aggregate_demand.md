# 06: Aggregate Demand

## The Multiplier

increased investment spending -> increased income and aggregate output -> increased disposable income -> increased consumer spending -> increased firm output -> ... 

marginal propensity to consume (MPC): increase in consumer spending when disposable income rises by $1    
MPC = &Delta; Consumer spending / &Delta; Disposable income 

marginal propensity to save (MPS): increase in household savings when disposable income rises by $1  
MPS = 1 - MPC

increase in investment spending = $100 billion  
second-round increase in consumer spending = MPC * $100 billion  
third-round increase in consumer spending = MPC<sup>2</sup> * $100 billion ...  
-> total increase in GDP = (1 + MPC + MPC<sup>2</sup> + ...) * $100 billion = 1/(1 - MPC) * $100 billion 

autonomous change in aggregate spending: initial rise or fall in aggregate spending, causes series of income/spending changes

multiplier: ratio of total change in real GDP caused by autonomous change in aggregate spending to size of autonomous change  
&Delta; Real GDP = 1/(1 - MPC) * &Delta; Autonomous change in aggregate spending  
multiplier = 1/(1 - MPC)

## Consumer Spending

consumption function: equation showing how individual household's consumer spending varies with the household's current disposable income

autonomous consumer spending: amount of money household would spend if it had no disposable income  

aggregate consumption function: relationship for economy as a whole between aggregate current disposable income and aggregate consumer spending
