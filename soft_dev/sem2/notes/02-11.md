Paths are used to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves  
- A context can keep track of one path at a time  
- The path is not drawn until stroke() is called  
- A path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called 

beginPath() - start/reset current path  
moveTo(x,y) - moves path to position, no line results    
lineTo(x,y) - moves path to position, line results  
closePath() - results in line from cur pos to start pos  
stroke() - renders all lines in path
